    <h1> My Cat's are the Best</h1>
    <p>I am a big cat fan. Cats have been a part of my life for as long as I can remember. They are friendly, great
        cuddlers, and even better listeners. So, it's safe to say that I have always had a better connection with cats
        than dogs. Currently we have five cats, and each have their own personalities. They all are very playful, and
        three of them are great listeners. Mama kitty is the proud mother of Mr. Fluffy pants, Murder Mittens, and Ozzy
        Ozborn (named after the singer). Our last cat, Jackel likes to be alone, and doesn't enjoy the company of
        others. I think I am partial to my cats, but I think they are quite swell.</p>

        article about how cats are great!</a>

    <p>Not to say that dogs are bad, but it is hard to compare them to cats. Dogs need consistent attention, along with
        more time outdoors. We currently have a dog, a chihuahua (which barely counts in my opinion), and he is awesome.
        He is incredibly friendly to other animals and despises other humans. Other than the fact that Pippin, our dog,
        barks at everything known to mankind, he is practically a cat in many ways.</p>
