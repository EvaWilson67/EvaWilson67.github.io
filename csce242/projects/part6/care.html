                        <h3>Lighting</h3>
                        <p>Most indoor plants do well with bright, indirect
                            light, where they get plenty of light without being exposed to harsh, direct sun. Some
                            plants, like succulents and cacti, need direct sunlight, while others, like pythos and
                            snake plants, are more adaptable to low-light conditions. Finding the right balance of light
                            is important to avoid issues like leaf burn.</p>

                        <h3>Watering</h3>
                        <p>Overwatering is a common mistake, so always check the soil before watering. Many plants
                            prefer to dry out a bit between waterings—especially succulents and cacti, which need
                            minimal water and thrive in drier conditions. For most indoor plants, water when the top
                            inch of soil feels dry to the touch. Ensure your plant has drainage holes to allow excess
                            water to escape and prevent root rot.</p>

                        <h3>Soil</h3>
                        <p>The type of soil you use depends on the plant’s needs. For example, succulents and cacti
                            require a fast-draining mix, such as cactus or succulent soil, to prevent water from sitting
                            around their roots. In contrast, indoor plants like ferns and pothos prefer a more
                            moisture-retentive, well-aerated mix, such as a peat-based or all-purpose potting soil. </p>

                        <h3>Fertilizer</h3>
                        <p> During the active growing season (spring and summer), plants benefit from regular feeding,
                            typically once a month, with a balanced, water-soluble fertilizer. This boosts their growth
                            and helps them produce vibrant leaves and flowers. In contrast, plants require less
                            fertilizer during the dormant period (fall and winter), as their growth slows down.</p>

                        <h3>Repotting</h3>
                        <p> Typically, you’ll need to repot every 1-2 years, depending on the plant's growth rate. Signs
                            it’s time to repot include roots growing out of the drainage holes, a plant becoming
                            top-heavy, or the soil drying out too quickly. Choose a pot that’s 1-2 inches larger in
                            diameter than the current one, and make sure it has proper drainage. </p>
